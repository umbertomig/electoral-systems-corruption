> **Abstract**: What are the effects of electoral systems and competition on political corruption? In this paper, I propose a formal model of political corruption where challengers may run anti-corruption campaigns against the incumbents. To understand how institutions and competition affect the results, I study two benchmarks: in the first, called the non-excludable anti-corruption campaign, successful exposure of an incumbent opens her seats to all other competitors. In the second benchmark, the excludable anti-corruption campaign, the politician successfully exposing the corruption signals competence, and voters tend to prefer her vis-a-vis the other challengers. When anti-corruption campaigns are non-excludable, an increase in the number of challengers or incumbents monotonically raises corruption. However, when anti-corruption campaigns are excludable, the number of challengers is endogenously limited. The excludability makes the free-riding in corruption exposure disappear. When I increase the number of incumbents, corruption rises less than in the non-excludable benchmark. These predictions hold empirically using quasi-experimental data from Brazilian and Italian municipalities. This study has implications for the design of electoral institutions and entry barriers in democratic elections.
